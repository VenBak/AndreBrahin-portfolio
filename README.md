## AndreBrahin-Portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project contains a portfolio website of myself in order for other people to have a platform to get to a little about me and look at the different projects that I have worked on. The motivation behind this project was to make an interactive website which changes format based on its sizing and to go through the learning process of making a fully worked through webpage. The specific problems that it solves is the difficulty certain peeople might have if they want to look into what I have done, and having a portfolio website trumps this difficulty by making myself more available.
